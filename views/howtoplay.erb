  <p>BlackJack >> <strong>"21"</strong></p>
  <p> Blackjack starts with players making bets.</p>
  <p>A player has minimum balance of $1000</p>
  <p>Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down).</p>
  <p>Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as either 1 or 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand</p>
  <p>Players must decide whether to stand, hit, surrender, double down, or split.</p>
  <p>The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21.</p>
  <p>  Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).</p>
  <%# <p>In order to win blackjack, you have to beat the dealer. If the final combined value of the cards is greater than that of dealer, you win. When you see the value of your blackjack cards and the value of one of the cards of the dealer, you can adjust your bets accordingly.</p>
  <p>You can "HIT" to add more cards and "STAND" to stop. The dealer always has to hit if the value of their card is 16 or lower, and he must stop hitting when the value reaches 17 or more.</p> %>
